This web app is a platform for college students to share ideas and interact with each other by making posts on the site as well as liking and commenting on each other's posts. The students were able to follow each other as well as unfollow each other.

I designed and developed a web application for my fellow college students that enabled them to interact with one another in the same way they do with Twitter, Instagram or Facebook without the clutter of ads and other none college related material.

I designed and created it using PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and the LAMP stack.
