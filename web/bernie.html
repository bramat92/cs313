					<h5 class="card-title">Golden State Warrior</h5>
					<p class="card-text">This is my favorite basketball team. I love the way they play and everything they stand for. They are a big inspiration to me. The have a well balanced team that most consider impossible to beat because of the amount of talent that the team as a whole posesses. With Steph Curry as their Captain and Kevin Durant as the forward and Green as the center and Klay Thompson as the sharp shooter. They are invincible! Their love for the game is evident. I learned a great deal from them after they lost the 2016 championship they came back with zeal and determination to claim what is rightfully theirs in the 2017 tournament; The Trophy. Cause they are that good. Believe it! The team was established in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, a founding member of the Basketball Association of America (BAA). In 1962, the franchise relocated to the San Francisco Bay Area and was renamed the San Francisco Warriors. In 1971, the team changed its geographic moniker to Golden State, California's state nickname. The team is nicknamed the Dubs as a shortening of "W's".</p>

					<h5 class="card-title">LDS Temples</h5>
					<p class="card-text">I love Temples. My Faith in God is my pride and joy and I cherish it every single day. I love visiting Temples and spending time in the presence of my Heavenly Father. The feeling within them is inexplicable because it fills you with power and inspiration to be able to cope with life. My goal is to visit all the Temples in the world when I make bank. Participating in temple ordinances is a wonderful and important part of your commitment to follow Jesus Christ. It is also an essential step toward someday returning to live with Him and our Heavenly Father. As you prepare for these sacred experiences, you will want to do all you can to make sure you are ready. Your preparation should include prayerfully studying the gospel of Jesus Christ and applying those teachings in your life. The foundation of your preparation for the temple will be to faithfully honor the sacred covenants you have already made.</p>

		<p id="footerText">"Infuse your life with action. Don't wait for it to happen. Make it happen. Make your own future. Make your own hope. Make your own love. And whatever your beliefs, honor your creator, not by passively waiting for grace to come down from upon high, but by doing what you can to make grace happen... yourself, right now, right down here on Earth."</p>
